# üéØ SINGLE NODE EXECUTION FIX COMPLETE!

## ‚úÖ PROBLEM SOLVED

**Issue:** When selecting a single node and running it, the workflow would continue executing all subsequent nodes instead of stopping at the selected node.

**Solution:** Added dedicated "Run Selected Node Only" functionality with proper UI controls and execution logic.

## üöÄ NEW FEATURES ADDED

### 1. **"Run Selected Node Only" Button** ‚ö°
- **Location:** Top toolbar, appears when a node is selected
- **Icon:** Lightning bolt (‚ö°) with orange styling
- **Behavior:** Only executes the selected node, stops there
- **Tooltip:** "Run Selected Node Only"

### 2. **Enhanced Execution Logic** üîß
- Uses existing `onlyNodeId` parameter in execution engine
- Proper single node isolation
- Clear logging to show which node is being executed
- Separate error handling for single node vs full workflow

### 3. **Smart UI Controls** üé®
- Button only appears when a node is selected
- Hides during execution to prevent conflicts
- Different styling (orange) to distinguish from full workflow run (purple/blue)
- Clear visual feedback

## üéØ HOW IT WORKS

### **Before Fix:**
1. Select a node
2. Click "Run" ‚Üí Entire workflow executes from that node forward
3. No way to test just one node in isolation

### **After Fix:**
1. Select a node
2. See two buttons:
   - ‚ö° **"Run Selected Node Only"** (orange) - Executes ONLY that node
   - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **"Run Workflow"** (purple/blue) - Executes full workflow
3. Choose the appropriate execution mode

## üî• EXECUTION MODES

### **Single Node Mode** (‚ö° Lightning Button)
- Executes ONLY the selected node
- Stops immediately after that node completes
- Perfect for testing individual blocks
- Shows: `üéØ Running single node: [type] ([id])`

### **Full Workflow Mode** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play Button)  
- Executes the complete workflow from start
- Continues through all connected nodes
- Standard workflow execution
- Shows: `üöÄ Starting workflow: [name]`

## üé® VISUAL INDICATORS

### **Run Selected Node Button:**
- **Color:** Orange border and text
- **Icon:** Lightning bolt (‚ö°)
- **Visibility:** Only when node is selected
- **State:** Disabled during execution

### **Run Workflow Button:**
- **Color:** Purple-to-blue gradient
- **Icon:** Play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
- **Visibility:** Always visible
- **State:** Changes to red stop button during execution

## üìã USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### **To Run a Single Node:**
1. Click on any node to select it
2. Look for the orange lightning bolt (‚ö°) button in the top toolbar
3. Click the lightning bolt button
4. Watch the console - only that node will execute
5. Execution stops after the selected node completes

### **To Run Full Workflow:**
1. Click the purple/blue play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
2. Entire workflow executes from start to finish
3. All connected nodes run in sequence

## üîç DEBUGGING BENEFITS

### **Perfect for Testing:**
- Test individual nodes without running entire workflow
- Debug specific node configurations
- Validate node inputs/outputs in isolation
- Quick iteration on single blocks

### **Development Workflow:**
1. Build workflow step by step
2. Test each node individually as you add it
3. Verify node outputs before connecting to next node
4. Debug issues at the node level

## üéâ **READY TO USE!**

The single node execution feature is now fully implemented and ready to use. You can:

‚úÖ Select any node and run it in isolation
‚úÖ Test individual blocks without full workflow execution  
‚úÖ Debug node-specific issues easily
‚úÖ Iterate quickly on node configurations
‚úÖ See clear visual feedback for execution mode

**Select a node and look for the orange lightning bolt (‚ö°) button in the toolbar!**
