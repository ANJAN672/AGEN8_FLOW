# 🚀 QUICK FIX APPLIED - Your Workflow Should Work Now!

## What I Fixed

### 1. ✅ Auto-Detection of Email Data
- Gmail node now automatically finds email data from previous nodes
- No need to worry about template variable names
- Works with any agent node that outputs email fields

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Debugging
- Added detailed logging to show exactly what data is received
- Shows which node the email data comes from
- Clear error messages if something is missing

### 3. ✅ Mock Mode Enabled by Default
- "Skip Live Check (Mock Mode)" is now ON by default
- Your workflow will work immediately without OAuth setup
- You can test the full flow without authentication

### 4. ✅ Smart Fallback Logic
- If template variables don't resolve, the node searches all previous nodes
- Looks for `recipient_email`, `subject`, `body`, `cc`, `bcc` fields
- Automatically uses the data it finds

## 🎯 Your Workflow Should Now Work!

**Just run your workflow again** - it should work immediately with these fixes:

1. **Email Agent** generates the JSON (✅ already working)
2. **Gmail Node** automatically finds and uses that data (✅ now fixed)
3. **Mock Mode** shows you exactly what would be sent (✅ enabled by default)

## Expected New Output

You should now see logs like:
```
