# Test Your Fixed Workflow

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Fix Template Variables in Your Workflow
In your Gmail node, update the field values:

**Current (Incorrect):**
- To: `{{email_agent.recipient_email}}` ‚úÖ (This is correct)
- Subject: `{{agent.subject}}` ‚ùå 
- Body: `{{agent.body}}` ‚ùå

**Fixed (Correct):**
- To: `{{email_agent.recipient_email}}`
- Subject: `{{email_agent.subject}}`
- Body: `{{email_agent.body}}`

### 2. Enable Mock Mode for Testing
1. In your Gmail node, find the "Skip Live Check (Mock Mode)" toggle
2. Turn it ON
3. This allows testing without OAuth setup

### 3. Run the Workflow
1. Click "Run Workflow"
2. Check the execution log for detailed output

## Troubleshooting

### "Template variables showing as empty"
- Check that you're using `{{email_agent.field_name}}` not `{{agent.field_name}}`

### "Authentication issue: Failed to get user info"
- Enable "Skip Live Check (Mock Mode)" for testing
- Or set up proper OAuth credentials

### "To address and subject are required"
- Verify the email_agent is generating the expected JSON output
- Check template variable names are correct
